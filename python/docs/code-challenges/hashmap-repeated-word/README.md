## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
For this approach, utilized regex in order to split the words at the correct spacial intervals. Then once the words were split, looped through them to check if any repeats existed in the set. Otherwise, add it to the set.
Big O Notation for this O(N) for both time space. 

## Solution

```python

pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -k test_hashtable_repeated-word.py

```
