# Hash Tables

Hash Tables is another data structure containing Nodes. Contain two main components: `Key` and `Value`. Hashtables have an array structure at the base and are usually quite large. The Key will always reference a value at a certain index, making it time efficient since the algorithm does not need to search through the entire array index.

## Challenge

The challenge today was:



## Approach & Efficiency

Took a rigorious testing approach in which I developed the functions around the pre-existing tests. First, I understood what the test required then built the function, values, and functionality from there. Big O notation for a hash table is O(1) for time and O(N) for space.
