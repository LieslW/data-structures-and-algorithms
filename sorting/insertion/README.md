# Insertion Sort

**Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that utilizes comparing values together and sorting them. The algorithm does this throughout the list until all have been sorted properly. 

## Pseudocode

```python

  InsertionSort(int[] arr)

    FOR i = 1 to arr.length

      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]

      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1

      arr[j + 1] <-- temp

```
